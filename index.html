            <div class="col">
            <h3>Breed</h3>
            <p>She is a lhasa apso. A non-sporting breed of small dogs originating from Tibet where they were highly regarded watchdogs in the palaces and monasteries of their mountainous homeland.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col">
            <h3>Behaviour</h3>
            <p>She is a very shy dog, so she tends to be hostile towards unfamiliar faces. This is in part due to her protective nature, but she warms up and is really playful once she gets comfortable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col">
            <h3>Appetite</h3>
            <p>She eats a lot lol. Her appetite is high, and so she's bigger than the average size for a 9-month old lhasa, but she is not overweight and she is very healthy</p>
